## Three Years

Three years ago today, we sat in that tiny ramen shop in Shibuya and decided this was worth trying. Not the ramen (though it was excellent) â€” us.

### Karuizawa Weekend

For our anniversary, we escaped to Karuizawa. October is perfect â€” the autumn colors are at their peak, and the crowds from summer have thinned out.

**Day 1**: 
- Morning walk through the fall foliage
- Lunch at a local soba restaurant
- Afternoon at the church we always pass but never enter
- Dinner: yakiniku & too much wine

**Day 2**:
- Coffee at that bookstore cafe with floor-to-ceiling windows
- Browsed for hours without buying anything (progress!)
- Found a stray cat, fed it, got adopted for 10 minutes

## What I've Learned

**Year 1**: Everything is exciting and perfect  
**Year 2**: Everything is still exciting, definitely not perfect  
**Year 3**: We've figured out breakfast routines and which side of the bed is whose

The small things matter. Like how you always make coffee stronger than I like it, but I drink it anyway because you made it. Or how I organize your cables even though you claim chaos is your system.

## Looking Forward

Here's to more quiet weekends, loud adventures, and figuring out life together.

Love you, dummy. ðŸ’•
