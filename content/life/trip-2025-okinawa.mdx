## The Journey

We landed in Naha on a crisp February morning. Winter in Okinawa means 20°C weather — perfect escape from the mainland cold.

### Day 1: Naha & Shuri Castle

Started with a visit to Shuri Castle. Even after the 2019 fire, the restored sections are breathtaking. The vermillion red against the blue sky is *chef's kiss*.

Lunch was at a small izakaya near Kokusai Street:
- Goya champuru (bitter melon stir-fry)
- Okinawa soba
- Orion beer (obviously)

The goya was perfectly balanced — not too bitter, with just the right amount of bonito flakes.

### Day 2-3: Miyako Island

Took a short flight to Miyako. The beaches here are unreal:

**Yonaha Maehama Beach**: 7km of white sand and turquoise water. We spent the entire afternoon just floating and watching the sky.

**Snorkeling at Aragusuku**: Saw sea turtles! Three of them, casually swimming past us like we weren't even there.

## Food Highlights

- **Taco Rice**: Okinawan fusion at its finest
- **Sata Andagi**: Like doughnut holes but better
- **Fresh Mozuku seaweed**: Tangy, slippery, addictive

## Reflections

There's something about island time that just... slows everything down. No rush, no stress. Just waves, sunshine, and the occasional shisa statue keeping watch.

Already planning the next trip. Maybe in summer for the beach festivals.
