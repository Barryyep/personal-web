## Overview

At A&C Future, I worked on large-scale **ETL pipelines and analytics systems** serving 6M+ user records, while also shipping user-facing React-Native features with integrated event tracking.

## The Challenge

- **Data integrity** issues across millions of records  
- **User behavior analysis** requiring detailed event tracking  
- **Community perception** analysis from 30k+ social media comments  

## Architecture Decisions

### Airflow-Powered ETL
- Designed DAGs to ingest and transform data daily.  
- Improved coverage and reliability, eliminating prior integrity issues.  

### React-Native Analytics Integration
- Built components with event tracking hooks.  
- Enabled growth, retention, and behavior analysis at scale.  

### ML-Based Sentiment Analysis
- Applied transformer models to classify 30k+ comments from Telegram and Twitter.  
- Extracted actionable insights on engagement and brand perception.  

## Key Learnings
- Balancing **ETL reliability** with analytics accuracy is key in fast-growth environments.  
- **Event instrumentation** directly empowers growth decisions.  

## Metrics
- 6M+ user records processed  
- 30k+ social media comments analyzed  
- Analytics dashboards adopted company-wide
