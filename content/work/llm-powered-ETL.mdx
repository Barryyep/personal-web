## The Challenge

- Aggregate **multi-source data daily**  
- Deliver insights reliably for hundreds of companies  
- Enable **real-time querying** of corporate knowledge  

## Architecture Decisions

### LLM-Powered ETL
- Web scraping with Selenium and cron jobs  
- FastAPI services orchestrating daily ingestion  
- Data stored in AWS DynamoDB  

### Chatbot with RAG
- Integrated with Lark for real-time Q&A  
- Used Zilliz vector DB for retrieval  

## Key Learnings
- **LLM pipelines must be productionized** with monitoring and retries.  
- Reliability > flashy models in enterprise workflows.  

## Metrics
- 14+ months continuous production uptime  
- 800+ companies ingested daily  
- Deployed chatbot serving real-time analysts
